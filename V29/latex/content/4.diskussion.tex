\section{Discussion}
Unlike in the real world, 
various simplifications are made in the kit.
As a result, 
the data noise is completely eliminated, 
which is reflected in a QBER value of 0\% for both experiments without Eve.
This allows for a precise understanding of the BB84 protocol, 
but it must be taken into account when interpreting the results.
Furthermore, 
single photons were not used, 
instead, 
laser pulses were employed. 
These pulses, 
with different polarizations between sender and receiver, 
were not detected randomly by a detector.
Rather, in this case, 
both detectors received the same incident intensity.
Which detector ultimately registered a photon was determined randomly by software.

Through these simplifications, 
an experiment is obtained that works very precisely and illustrates the method clearly.
However, 
it should be noted that this experiment does not involve single-photon measurements.
